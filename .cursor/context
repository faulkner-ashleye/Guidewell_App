# Guidewell Project Context

## Current State
- React app with onboarding flow implemented
- Plaid Link integration for account connection
- Express server with mock endpoints
- Photo/document upload functionality
- Global state management with Context API

## Recent Work
- Fixed Plaid Link duplicate script warnings
- Implemented singleton pattern for Plaid Link
- Enhanced DocUpload component with camera capture
- Added debounce mechanism to prevent multiple requests
- Created comprehensive onboarding flow

## Key Components
- PlaidLinkButton: Handles Plaid Link integration
- DocUpload: Photo/document upload with preview
- Onboarding: Multi-step flow for user setup
- Connect: Account connection step
- AppStateContext: Global state management

## Server Endpoints
- POST /plaid/link/token/create
- POST /plaid/item/public_token/exchange
- GET /plaid/accounts
- GET /test (health check)

## Known Issues
- Multiple link token requests (being addressed with debounce)
- Server needs proper Plaid credentials for production
- Need to implement real document parsing

## Next Steps
- Implement real document parsing
- Add more account types
- Enhance mobile UX
- Add data persistence
- Implement user authentication

## Architecture Decisions
- Using Context API instead of Redux for simplicity
- Express server for Plaid integration
- Mobile-first design approach
- Educational focus with compliance disclaimers
- Singleton pattern for Plaid Link to prevent duplicates
